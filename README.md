# Fly-Catcher
A fun and interactive Python game where a frog catches flies! Test your reflexes and aim as you help the frog gobble up flies using the arrow keys.

## Description
Fly Catcher is a simple yet engaging game built with Python and Pygame. The game features a frog that moves using the **arrow keys** (up, down, left, right) to catch flies. Players score points by catching as many flies as possible. It's a perfect project to enjoy and showcase the basics of game development in Python.
